README.md for node_learning

VS Code editor being used to create / edit this file.

From this directory, on iBeege:
$ code README.md

Markdown tags in VS code?

Apparently shift-cmd-V opened a new tab with a preview of this file.

A "fenced-codeblock" is defined below ...
```
if a=b; then
    prepareLauncher
else
    something else
fi
```
That should be a code block above this line ...
